Write an app which provides for a simple math training.
The app should have a constant for the max value it will use in its exercise (e.g. 20).
The app will produce "math exercises" built of a random number, within the defined max value, a single operation and a second random number within max value (e.g. "5 + 19").
An operation can only be one of plus, minus and multiply.
Once started, the app will loop over the following steps:
1. Showing the user an exercise (e.g. "5 x 11 =")
2. Getting the user numeric answer
3. Printing "correct" if the answer is correct, or "incorrect" and the right answer, if answer was not correct.
The loop ends when the user enters any non-numeric value.
Note: Pay attention to proper use of functions. Make sure you break overall functionality to small, focused functions.
